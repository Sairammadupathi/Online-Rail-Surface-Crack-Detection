This method revolutionizes railway track inspections using drones equipped with high-resolution cameras to capture detailed images. Advanced image processing techniques, such as edge detection and adaptive thresholding, prepare these images for analysis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ResNet architectures are employed to detect and categorize cracks with high accuracy. The system is scalable and robust, handling large datasets and varying track conditions efficiently. Visual outputs and detailed reports aid in quick and accurate maintenance, enhancing the safety and reliability of railway infrastructure.
